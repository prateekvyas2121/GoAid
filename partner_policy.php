the driver during your trip and linked to your account, even if you have not enabled GoAid<br />

2. Grounds for Processing<br />
The GDPR requires that companies processing the personal data of INDIA users do so on the basis of specific<br />
legal grounds. As described below, GoAid processes the information of INDIA users based on one or more<br />
of the grounds specified under the GDPR:<br />
&nbsp;a. The processing is necessary to provide the services and features you request<br />
&nbsp;GoAid must collect and use certain information in order to provide its services. This<br />
includes:<br />
&nbsp;User profile information that is necessary to establish and maintain your account,<br />
including to verify your identity; enable communications with you about your trips,<br />
orders and accounts; and to enable you to make payments or receive earnings.<br />
&nbsp;Background check Information necessary to enable drivers to provide transportation<br />
services through the GoAid app.<br />
&nbsp;Driver location Information, which is necessary to match drivers with riders, and to<br />
track trips while in-progress and suggest navigation.<br />
&nbsp;Transaction information, which is necessary to generate and maintain in connection<br />
with your use of GoAid services.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">&nbsp;Usage information, which is necessary to maintain, optimize and enhance GoAid<br />
services, including to determine, sometimes in combination with other information,<br />
incentives, connect riders and drivers, and calculate costs of trips and driver earnings.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">&nbsp;Collection and use of this information is a requirement for using GoAid&nbsp;apps.<br />
&nbsp;b. The processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of our users or of others<br />
&nbsp;GoAid may process personal information, including disclosing data with law enforcement<br />
authorities in case of threats to the safety of users or of others.<br />
&nbsp;c. The processing is necessary for GoAid&nbsp;legitimate interests<br />
&nbsp;GoAid collects and uses personal information to the extent necessary for its legitimate<br />
interests. This includes collecting and using information:<br />
&nbsp;To maintain and enhance our users&nbsp;safety and security. For example, we collect<br />
background check information (where permitted by law) to prevent unsafe users<br />
from providing services through our apps. We also use personal information to<br />
prevent use of our services by users who have engaged in inappropriate or dangerous<br />
behavior, such as by retaining information of banned users to prevent their use of<br />
GoAid apps. We also use usage information to prevent matching of riders and<br />
drivers for whom there is higher risk of conflict (e.g., because they have been the<br />
subject of prior complaints from other users).<br />
&nbsp;To prevent, detect and combat fraud in connection with the use of our services. For<br />
example, GoAid&nbsp;uses user profile, location, device and usage information, to<br />
identify and prevent circumstances when users attempt to defraud GoAid or other<br />
users.<br />
&nbsp;To inform law enforcement officials regarding criminal acts or threats to public<br />
safety.<br />
&nbsp;To provide customer support.<br />
&nbsp;To optimize our service and develop new services. This includes, for example,<br />
identifying the best pick-up / drop locations, recommending (new) features,<br />
improving navigation, and enhancing pricing and matching riders and drivers or<br />
delivery recipients and partners.<br />
&nbsp;For research and analytical purposes. This includes, for example, analyzing usage<br />
trends to improve the user experience and enhance the safety and security of our<br />
services.<br />
&nbsp;For direct marketing purposes. This includes, for example, analysing data to identify<br />
trends and tailor marketing messages to user needs.<br />
&nbsp;To enforce GoAid&nbsp;Terms of Service.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">&nbsp;d. The processing is necessary for the legitimate interests of other persons or parties<br />
&nbsp;GoAid collects and uses personal information to the extent necessary for the interests of<br />
other persons or the general public. This includes sharing information in connection with<br />
legal or insurance claims, to protect the rights and safety of others.<br />
&nbsp;GoAid may also process personal information when necessary in regards to a substantial<br />
public interest, on the basis of applicable laws.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">&nbsp;e. The processing is necessary to fulfill GoAid&sect;&amp;#39;s legal obligations<br />
&nbsp;GoAid is subject to legal requirements in the jurisdictions in which it operates that require<br />
us to collect, process, disclose and retain your personal data. For example, GoAid is subject<br />
to laws and regulations in many cities and countries that require it to collect and retain<br />
information about your trips, to retain such information for extended periods of time, and to<br />
provide copies of such information to governmental or other authorities. GoAid uses your<br />
information to comply with such laws to the extent they apply to your use of the GoAid<br />
apps.<br />
f. Consent</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">&nbsp;GoAid may collect and use your information on the basis of your consent. You may revoke<br />
your consent at any time. If you revoke your consent, you will not be able to use any service<br />

The Privacy Settings menu in the GoAid rider app gives users the the ability to set or update their location<br />

Information on these settings, how to set or change these settings, and the effect of turning off these settings<br />
are described below.<br />
&nbsp;Location Information<br />
&nbsp;GoAid uses rider&nbsp;device location services to make it easier to get a safe, reliable ride<br />
whenever you need one. Location data helps improve our services, including pickups,<br />
navigation, and customer support.<br />
&nbsp;You may enable/disable, or adjust, GoAidcollection of rider location information at any<br />
time through the Privacy Settings menu in the GoAid app, or via the settings on your<br />
mobile device. If you disable the device location services on your device, your use of the<br />
GoAid app will be affected. For example, you will need to manually enter your pickup or<br />
dropoff locations. In addition, location information will be collected from the driver during</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">your trip and linked to your account, even if you have not enabled GoAid to collect your<br />
location information.<br />
&nbsp;Share Live Location (Riders)<br />
&nbsp;If you have enabled the device location services on your mobile device, you may also enable<br />
GoAid to share your location with your driver from the time you request a ride to the start<br />
of your trip. This makes it easier for your driver to pick you up.<br />
&nbsp;You may enable/disable location sharing with your driver at any time through the Privacy<br />
Settings menu in the GoAid app. You may use the GoAid app if you have not enabled<br />
location sharing, but it may be more difficult for your driver to locate you.</span></span></p>

Most mobile platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access<br />
without your consent. And these platforms have different permission systems for obtaining your consent. The<br />
iOS platform will alert you the first time the GoAid app wants permission to access certain types of data and<br />
will let you consent (or not consent) to that request. Android devices will notify you of the permissions that the<br />
GoAid app seeks before you first use the app, and your use of the app constitutes your consent.<br />
C. RATINGS LOOK-UP<br />

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif"><strong>SUMMARY</strong></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">Beginning March 05,2019, the processing of personal data of users in India.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">This section summarizes GoAid&rsquo;s grounds for processing personal information under the<br />
GDPR, and the rights of INDIA users as relates to GoAid&rsquo;s handling of personal information.<br />
1. INDIA User Rights<br />

regarding GoAid;s retention and deletion practices.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">&nbsp;d. Objections and complaints<br />
&nbsp;Users in the INDIA have the right to object to GoAid&nbsp;s processing of personal data,<br />
including for marketing purposes based on profiling and/or automated decision making.<br />
GoAid may continue to process your information notwithstanding the objection to the<br />
extent permitted under GDPR.<br />

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">&nbsp;You may also submit questions, comments or complaints to GoAid&nbsp;Data Protection<br />
Officer.<br />
2. Grounds for Processing<br />
The GDPR requires that companies processing the personal data of INDIA users do so on the basis of specific<br />
legal grounds. As described below, GoAid processes the information of INDIA users based on one or more<br />
of the grounds specified under the GDPR:<br />
&nbsp;a. The processing is necessary to provide the services and features you request<br />
&nbsp;GoAid must collect and use certain information in order to provide its services. This<br />
includes:<br />
&nbsp;User profile information that is necessary to establish and maintain your account,<br />
including to verify your identity; enable communications with you about your trips,<br />
orders and accounts; and to enable you to make payments or receive earnings.<br />
&nbsp;Background check Information necessary to enable drivers to provide transportation<br />
services through the GoAid app.<br />
&nbsp;Driver location Information, which is necessary to match drivers with riders, and to<br />
track trips while in-progress and suggest navigation.<br />
&nbsp;Transaction information, which is necessary to generate and maintain in connection<br />
with your use of GoAid services.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">&nbsp;Usage information, which is necessary to maintain, optimize and enhance GoAid<br />
services, including to determine, sometimes in combination with other information,<br />
incentives, connect riders and drivers, and calculate costs of trips and driver earnings.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">&nbsp;Collection and use of this information is a requirement for using GoAid&nbsp;apps.<br />
&nbsp;b. The processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of our users or of others<br />
&nbsp;GoAid may process personal information, including disclosing data with law enforcement<br />
authorities in case of threats to the safety of users or of others.<br />
&nbsp;c. The processing is necessary for GoAid&nbsp;legitimate interests<br />
&nbsp;GoAid collects and uses personal information to the extent necessary for its legitimate<br />
interests. This includes collecting and using information:<br />
&nbsp;To maintain and enhance our users&nbsp;safety and security. For example, we collect<br />
background check information (where permitted by law) to prevent unsafe users<br />
from providing services through our apps. We also use personal information to<br />
prevent use of our services by users who have engaged in inappropriate or dangerous<br />
behavior, such as by retaining information of banned users to prevent their use of<br />
GoAid apps. We also use usage information to prevent matching of riders and<br />
drivers for whom there is higher risk of conflict (e.g., because they have been the<br />
subject of prior complaints from other users).<br />
&nbsp;To prevent, detect and combat fraud in connection with the use of our services. For<br />
example, GoAid&nbsp;uses user profile, location, device and usage information, to<br />
identify and prevent circumstances when users attempt to defraud GoAid or other<br />
users.<br />
&nbsp;To inform law enforcement officials regarding criminal acts or threats to public<br />
safety.<br />
&nbsp;To provide customer support.<br />
&nbsp;To optimize our service and develop new services. This includes, for example,<br />
identifying the best pick-up / drop locations, recommending (new) features,<br />
improving navigation, and enhancing pricing and matching riders and drivers or<br />
delivery recipients and partners.<br />
&nbsp;For research and analytical purposes. This includes, for example, analyzing usage<br />
trends to improve the user experience and enhance the safety and security of our<br />
services.<br />
&nbsp;For direct marketing purposes. This includes, for example, analysing data to identify<br />
trends and tailor marketing messages to user needs.<br />
&nbsp;To enforce GoAid&nbsp;Terms of Service.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">&nbsp;d. The processing is necessary for the legitimate interests of other persons or parties<br />
&nbsp;GoAid collects and uses personal information to the extent necessary for the interests of<br />
other persons or the general public. This includes sharing information in connection with<br />
legal or insurance claims, to protect the rights and safety of others.<br />
&nbsp;GoAid may also process personal information when necessary in regards to a substantial<br />
public interest, on the basis of applicable laws.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">&nbsp;e. The processing is necessary to fulfill GoAid&sect;&amp;#39;s legal obligations<br />
&nbsp;GoAid is subject to legal requirements in the jurisdictions in which it operates that require<br />
us to collect, process, disclose and retain your personal data. For example, GoAid is subject<br />
to laws and regulations in many cities and countries that require it to collect and retain<br />
information about your trips, to retain such information for extended periods of time, and to<br />
provide copies of such information to governmental or other authorities. GoAid uses your<br />
information to comply with such laws to the extent they apply to your use of the GoAid<br />
apps.<br />
f. Consent</span></span></p>

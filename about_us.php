							<li>Over the last two decades, we have evolved to become one of the most clinically advanced ambulance services in the world, with a focus on providing all our patients with high quality care and service.</li>
							<li>We are the forefront of innovation in unplanned clinical care. We provide thousands of patients a year with advice, support and signposting to the right services through our “hear and treat” services. We take hundreds of thousands of patients to a place of care, or home, every year through our Non-Emergency Patient Transport Service (NEPTS).</li>
							<li>Our call handlers and clinical contact centre staff deal with more than  a thousand calls every year, 24/7 and 365 days a year. And we are at the frontline of service delivery, making sure that patients get the right advice and help.</li>
							<li>We serve72 thousand -plus people in India, and provide services across the country.</li>
							<li>But our varied and modern services are tailor-made for each community’s differing environmental and medical needs, from cycles to fast response cars, frontline ambulances and nurses in our contact centres.</li>
							<li>We operate from 15 ambulance stations, three contact centres, three regional offices and five vehicle workshops. </li>
							<li>We also have our own National Training College to ensure our staff remain at the top of their game and receive regular professional development. </li>
							<li>We provide access to high quality, on-going training, regular continuous professional development opportunities and personal annual development reviews.</li>
							<li>We are also the host for the 108 service, which is an amalgamation of NHS Direct India (a 24 hour health advice and information service for the public) and the front end call handling and clinical triage elements of the GP out-of-hours services. </li>
